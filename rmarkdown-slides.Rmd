# Introduction

## What is R Markdown / Bookdown?

**R Markdown** is a system for writing mathematical/statistical documents.

- R Markdown documents can be produced in numerous formats, including accessible HTML.

**Bookdown** is a package for R Markdown that provides extra features useful for long documents.

- R Markdown example: [A worksheet for MATH1710](https://mpaldridge.github.io/math1710/R7.html)
- Bookdown example: [MATH1710 lecture notes](https://mpaldridge.github.io/math1710/)


## What is Markdown?

**Markdown** is a "mark-up" language (like LaTeX or HTML), where special characters and commands tell the computer what formatting you want.

- Markdown is extremely easy for humans to read

## What is Markdown?

**Markdown** is a "mark-up" language (like LaTeX or HTML), where special characters and commands tell the computer what formatting you want.

- Markdown is extremely easy for humans to read
- Programs like **Pandoc** can compile Markdown documents to many different formats:
  - most important: HTML (fully accessible) and PDF
  - also: EPUB ebook, Microsoft Word document, etc.
  - Can be built to multiple formats simultaneously
- Markdown is simpler than LaTeX...
  - ...but much less powerful that LaTeX
  
## What is R Markdown?

**R Markdown** is a system to write and compile ("knit") Markdown documents using R...

## Wait... what is R?

**R** is a programming language that is very good at doing statistics.

- R is used by most statistics academics
- We teach R to our students (in MATH1710, MATH1712, etc.)

Using the program **RStudio** is a convenient way to work with the language R (and with R Markdown documents).

Demos later...

## What is R Markdown?

**R Markdown** is a system to write and compile ("knit") Markdown documents using R.

R Markdown adds to plain-Markdown:

- *Mathematical equations using LaTeX notation*
  - When "knitted" to HTML, this displays as fully accessible MathJax
  - Includes standard `amsmath` extras: `mathbb`, `mathcal`, `align`, `align*`, `cases`, `pmatrix`, etc
  - May not do super-complicated stuff
- You can include R code (or other programming languages) in cool ways
    - More on this later...

## What is Bookdown?

**Bookdown** is an extra package for R Markdown that is particularly useful for long documents.

- In HTML format, produces a full website of interlinked pages, one page per chapter
- Other HTML features: contents bar, search, colour schemes, font size adjustment, etc
- Adds LaTeX-like theorem/definition/proof environments
  
Compare earlier demos:

- R Markdown: [A worksheet for MATH1710](https://mpaldridge.github.io/math1710/R7.html)
- Bookdown: [MATH1710 lecture notes](https://mpaldridge.github.io/math1710/)

# My first R Markdown document

## R Markdown through RStudio

I *strongly recommend* using R Markdown via RStudio.

- (Recall that **RStudio** is the program to interact with the statistical programming language **R**)

To install on your own computer:

- *First* [install R](https://cran.r-project.org/)...
- ...*then* [install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

For a first try, I recommend instead the **RStudio Cloud**: <https://rstudio.cloud>

- Browser-based RStudio -- like Google Docs or Overleaf for RStudio.
- 25 hours per month free -- probably won't work for long-term use

## Demo

## Formatting with (R) Markdown I

| Appearance | (R) Markdown code |
|:---:|:---:|
| **Bold text** | `**Bold text**` |
| *Italic text* | `*Italic text*` |
| `Fixed width` | `` `Fixed width` `` |
| [Link](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths) | `[Link](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths)` |

Or, use the **visual editor**.

# My first Bookdown document

## Demo

Bookdown is trickier in RStudio Cloud, so I will revert to RStudio as installed on my computer.

In R Studio:

- `File`
- `New Project`
- `New Directory`
- `Book project using bookdown`
- `Create Project`

[demo]


## Theorem environments: good news

LaTeX:

```
\begin{theorem}[Fermat's last theorem] \label{FLT}
No three positive integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ satisfy the equation
$a^n + b^n = c^n$ for any integer value of $n$ greater than $2$.
\end{theorem}

As we saw in Theorem \ref{FLT}\dots
```

R Markdown, with the Bookdown package:

```
::: {.theorem #FLT name="Fermat's last theorem"}
No three positive integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ satisfy the equation
$a^n + b^n = c^n$ for any integer value of $n$ greater than $2$.
:::

As we saw in Theorem \@ref(thm:FLT)...
```

## Theorem environments: old news

Previously,

    ```{theorem}`r ''`
    Your theorem here.
    ```
    
had been recommended, but the newer

```
::: {.theorem}
Your theorem here.
:::
```

method is better.


## Theorem environments: bad news

Theorem-like environments in Bookdown are much less flexible than their LaTeX equivalents.

- You have `theorem`, `lemma`, `corollary`, `proposition`, `conjecture`, `definition`, `example`, `exercise`, `hypothesis`
  - But, unlike LaTeX, you can't define your own new environments
  
<div class="columns-2">
- The numbering is, by force:
  - Theorem 2.1
  - Theorem 2.2
  - Lemma 2.1
  - Definition 2.1
  - Theorem 2.3

Â 

- ...although many prefer:
  - Theorem 2.1
  - Theorem 2.2
  - Lemma 2.3
  - Definition 2.4
  - Theorem 2.5
</div>

# R code in R Markdown

## Demo R code

Here is some R code:

```
data <- rnorm(100)
mean(data)
hist(data)
```

R experts will know that this:

- Generates 100 normally distributed random variates
- Calculates the mean of this data
- Plots a histogram of this data

## R code in R Markdown

I can include that R code it in an R Markdown document like this:

    Here is some R code:

    ```{r}`r ''`
    data <- rnorm(100)
    mean(data)
    hist(data)
    ```
    
Note that the code is preceded with three "backticks" ` ``` ` and `{r}`, then ends with three more backticks.

The result is the following...

## {.smaller}

Here is some R code:

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6}
data <- rnorm(100)
mean(data)
hist(data)
```

## R code options

Note that the document displayed *both* the R commands *and* the output those commands produced.

- You can set it *just* to show the code...
  - ...or *just* the output
- There are many other options here
  - See [Section 2.6 of *R Markdown: The Definitive Guide*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/r-code.html) for details
  
## Other code languages in R Markdown

It is apparently possible to use other programming languages in R Markdown in the same way I demonstrated R code.

- Open with, for example: ` ```{python} `

See [Chapter 15 of the R Markdown cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/other-languages.html) for details.

I don't know anyone local who's tried this out and can advise us -- audience?

# Tips and tricks

## Tables

Tables in (R) Markdown are a bit fiddly...

```
| "Plain" R Markdown         | RMarkdown with Bookdown    |
|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| Good for short documents   | Good for long documents    |
| Slightly simpler to write  | Slightly trickier to write |
| PDF or accessible HTML     | PDF or accessible HTML     |
| LaTeX equations            | LaTeX equations            |
| Single HTML page           | Multi-page website         |
| No theorem environments    | Theorem environments       |
```

... so I recommend [this online Markdown table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables).

## Alt text {.smaller}

It is good accessibility practice to describe pictures with "alt text", for those using screenreaders.

Until recently, R Markdown simply re-used the caption as alt text...

- ...but often we want a brief caption for everyone and detailed alt text for screenreaders.

New syntax (as of April 2021):

    ```{r`r ''` demo-pic, fig.cap="Histogram of data", fig.alt="Histogram of data, showing a
        bell-shaped symmetric curve around x = 0, dying away at x = -3 and x = +3"}
    knitr::include_graphics("/figures/hist.png")
    ```
    
- `fig.cap = "..."` gives the (short) caption
- `fig.alt = "..."` gives the (long) alt text

## TikZ pictures

If you use TikZ to draw pictures in LaTeX, you can do this in R Markdown too.

    ```{tikz`r ''` demo-tikz, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Caption", fig.alt="Alt text"}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[thick] (0,0) rectangle (6,4);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    ```

Default picture types:

- PDF pictures in PDF documents
- PNG pictures in HTML documents
  - Should be possible to produce SVG pictures -- has anyone tried?

## Styling

Many of us will want to knit Bookdown documents to both PDF and HTML.

- LaTeX styling for PDF output can go in `preamble.tex`
  - You probably have your own favourite LaTeX tweaks
- CSS styling for HTML output can go in `style.css`
  - I like to draw boxes around theorems, to make it clearer where the start/end
  - I like to indent new paragraphs like LaTeX does
  - I don't want embedded videos to fill the whole page width
  - Feel free to copy [my `style.css` file](https://github.com/mpaldridge/math1710/blob/master/style.css) that does these (and some other things)

## ClavertonDown

[**ClavertonDown**](https://bathmash.github.io/clavertondown/index.html) is a package by the University of Bath, based on Bookdown.

It is arguably the gold standard in making accessible mathematical documents.

- Knits simultaneously to 7 (seven!) different formats
- High contrast colour scheme
- Technologically a bit ramshackle
- Has anyone local tried this?

## Show/Hide

Phil will (I think) demonstrate this shortly.

## Slides

R Markdown has a few formats for making slides.

- The simplest -- and least powerful/flexible -- is `ioslides` (it seems to me) which is what these slides use
- [R Markdown source for these slides](https://mpaldridge.github.io/rmarkdown/)
- In RStudio: `File` --- `New File` --- `R Markdown` and choose "Presentation"
- This is the first time I've done slides in R Markdown -- do any of the audience have more experience?


# And finally

## Should I use R Markdown / Bookdown or LaTeXML?

- *I want R (or other) code executed within my document*: **R Markdown** with optional Bookdown 
- *I want a system with a large user base that is under active development*: **RÂ Markdown** with optional Bookdown, probably
- *I want very smart appearance of an HTML website with minimal effort*: **Bookdown**

- *I want to convert existing LaTeX notes with minimal fiddling around*: **LaTeXML**
- *I want to produce HTML notes while learning minimal new stuff*: **LaTeXML**
