# Notes on R Markdown and Bookdown

**[Matthew Aldridge](https://mpaldridge.github.io)**

This page consists of various notes I've made on R Markdown and Bookdown for creating accessible mathematics lecture notes.

## My  brief introduction to R Markdown and Bookdown

* [A brief introduction to RMarkdown and Bookdown](https://mpaldridge.github.io/rmarkdown-bookdown/) This is from last summer, and is a little bit out of date. For example, it is now recommended to use `::: {.theorem}` for theorems, whereas this still recommends the old notation ` ```{theorem} `, which is less good.

## Teaching development morning, 2021

I'm giving a talk at the teaaching development morning for the School of Mathematics and the University of Leeds on 14 December 2021.

* **[Slides for my talk](rmarkdown-slides.html)**
* [R Markdown source code](https://github.com/mpaldridge/rmarkdown/blob/main/rmarkdown-slides.Rmd) for the above slides
* Handout for the talk "knitted" from exactly the same code as built the slides themselves [[HTML format]](rmarkdown-handout.html) or [[PDF format]](rmarkdown-handout.pdf)

## My Bookdown lecture notes

My notes for the University of Leeds module MATH1710 Probability and Statistics I were written in R Markdown with the Bookdown package. (A few R Worksheets at the end are written in "plain" R Markdown without Bookdown.)
